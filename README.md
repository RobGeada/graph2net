# graph2net

Tools for building models via connectivity matrices, reducing the problem of network design to simply specifying connectivity matrices!

## Usage
See the [Graph2Net Demo](https://github.com/RobGeada/graph2net/blob/master/Graph2Net%20Demo.ipynb) for usage.

## Future Plans
* More extensize testing of random cell networks
* Conversion to CUDA
* Evolution of cell matrices to find more optimal networks
